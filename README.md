# Nix Templates

My personal collection of development templates, opinionated and tailored to my
tastes. But if you happen to find and error or have an idea how a template can
be improved feel free to open a PR (I can't guarantee any merges of course).

To use these templates use the following command:

```nix
nix flake init -t git+https://codeberg.org/ginkogruen/nix-templates#gleam
```
